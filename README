This is SnackSndfileExt extension for the snack2.2 framework. Its main
purpose is to add reading capabilities for all the formats supported
by libsndfile library to snack2.2 and programs based on it (e.g.:
wavesurfer, transcriber, ...).

This extension was entirily written during my spare time. I will not
ask you for money, but to keep this code and its modifications free: I
will evaluate to release this code under any license that will give to
you and any other permission to freely distribute, modify and use this
software for any purposes (e.g.: the code is currently released under
any version of the LGPL of your choice). I will not evaluate any
license that will allow you to distribute modified version of this
code without giving to others the same permissions that you got from
me (e.g.: I will not evaluate BSD-like licenses).

The extension is still young and probably plenty of BUGs. BUG reports,
patches and suggestions are welcome.

To build and install the tcl package, follow the instructions in the
file INSTALL. For the inpatient:
./configure
make
make install

To build a Wavesurfer plugin without installing the package, copy the
following files into your .wavesurfer/<version>/plugin directory:

snack_sndfile_ext.tcl
sndfile.plug
libsnack_sndfile_ext.so
libsnack_sndfile_ext.so.0.0.0

these instructions are given for posix systems, for Windows, copy the
dll files instead.
